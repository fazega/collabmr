I recently updated to 1.18 with the Windows installer - note I am running as a non-Administrator on a corporate system. This changed the way I had previously installed to now installed in $HOME\AppData\Local which is great. My existing packages survived, but I was getting errors when updating packages. I also cannot install packages. I can reproduce this reliably and I have reset to factory defaults (removed .atom\) and this problem persists.
